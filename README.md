# Forcasting Rubin Binary Supermassive Black Hole Detection Rates via Machine Learning

This project is a part of the [Time-Domain Needles in Rubin's Haystacks](https://rubin-anomalies-workshop.github.io/pages/about.html) Workshop held at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics from April 17-19th, 2024.

#### Participants: Meg Davis (UConn, megan.c.davis@uconn.edu), et al!

## Summary & Goals:
Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used to search for binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). These searches, across existing time-domain surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general stochastic variability of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive periodic signal, especially when monitoring cadence and duration are limited. As Rubin will observe millions of quasars, there is hope that it will aid in finally confirming a detection of a binary SMBH system. In this Hack, we will explore the application of basic machine learning techniques to the binary detection problem by using thousands of sythetic Rubin observations of both binary and single quasars. The goals are as follows:
1. Identify pre-processing needs for light curve data.
2. Apply out-of-the-box, open-source ML classification algorithms from popular Python packages, such as [sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [keras](https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_classification_from_scratch/).
3. Identify common pitfalls, analysis missteps, and general recommendations for applying this detection method to this type of data.
4. Stretch goal: Explore need for and generate more complex, homebrewed algorithms.
   
This work is expected to become a journal article led M. Davis as a follow-up to [Davis et al. 2024](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad276e).
